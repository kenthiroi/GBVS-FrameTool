Covers a lot of horizontal space in front of him. As of 2.21 Patch no longer punishable on hit from point blank, but still negative enough to lose your turn. On block safety ranges depending on the range used. At point blank, Gran is punishable. However at farther lengths it can be spaced out to be safe and at most be 0 on block. On Counter Hit causes extended hitstun for a follow-up combo, but doesn't allow for a combo at point blank. Doesn't reliably combo from far pokes and the reduced hitbox and increased hurtbox with weak reward on hit makes it in the current meta a very mediocre move.\"\n};\nvar hRekka = {\n  moveName: 'H Overdrive Surge',\n  altName: '214H',\n  damage: '1200',\n  guard: 'Mid',\n  startup: '13',\n  active: '13',\n  recovery: '12',\n  onblock: '-8',\n  onhit: 'HKD (+49, +60@Corner)',\n  oncounterhit: 'HKD (+53, +64@Corner)',\n  clash: '4',\n  motion: ['214', 'h', 'or', '2', 'a', 'h'],\n  description: \"Wallbounces in the corner. \\nGran's primary juggle starter. \\nSimilar to 214M, but Gran dashes forward faster.

Her skills deal big damage at just about any range, so give her a call when it's about time to finish off the foe. All of her attacks can be spotdodged individually or avoided. When the timer runs out Lowain has punishable recovery frames. Make sure you finish them off or you push them far enough to avoid being punished\\nYggdrasil can be controlled to move back and fourth slowly, which can be used to fence your opponent in.\\nSince it's a knowledge check instead of guaranteed damage, it's slightly less useful against experienced players (you still get ridiculous chip damage) However, Lowain disappears when this move goes active.

It can be extended by holding U, and Soriz takes less damage while the stance is up. Keep in mind that like most armored moves, you will die if your HP drops below zero while armoring. Soriz also has access to the Reactive Muscles counterattack. You may choose to do the counterattack at any point in the stance animation whether or not your opponent hits you during it. If it counterhits a very close opponent, it will proc a cinematic zoom-in and build a very large amount of meter (20%). On crouching CH, it is possible to link into c.L. Reactive Muscles hits both in front and behind Soriz.
