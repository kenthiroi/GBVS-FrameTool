The damage is affected by Guts, but is not considered chip damage so if you don't have enough HP to take the attack you will still die. Even if the Counter does not come out on a successful parry, Charlotta is still invulnerable for the rest of the duration and +39 as the opponent is staggered.\\nCounter: If the opponent is close enough when their move is parried, a Counter slash automatically activates for damage, a side switch, and a hard knockdown. If the opponent had a normal move parried, they cannot cancel it with anything to retaliate.\\n5U is a fairly reliable anti-air option, as it will trigger even against jump normals from far above you. However, its horizontal activation range is poor. Regardless, the move can still be used to counter fireballs, as they will activate the Counter If you're close enough.\"\n};\nvar groundThrow = {\n  moveName: 'Ground Throw',\n  damage: '1500',\n  guard: 'throw',\n  startup: '7',\n  active: '-',\n  recovery: '-',\n  onblock: '-',\n  onhit: '-',\n  oncounterhit: '-',\n  clash: '-',\n  motion: ['l', 'm', 'or', 'l', 'u'],\n  description: \"\"\n};\nvar airThrow = {\n  moveName: 'Air Throw',\n  damage: '1500',\n  guard: 'throw',\n  startup: '5',\n  active: '-',\n  recovery: '-',\n  onblock: '-',\n  onhit: '-',\n  oncounterhit: '-',\n  clash: '-',\n  motion: ['l', 'm', 'or', 'l', 'u'],\n  description: \"\"\n};\nvar uOverhead = {\n  moveName: 'Overhead',\n  altName: 'UOH',\n  damage: '1000',\n  guard: 'high',\n  startup: '26',\n  active: '-',\n  recovery: '-',\n  onblock: '-4',\n  onhit: '1',\n  oncounterhit: '-',\n  clash: '-',\n  motion: ['m', 'u'],\n  description: \"Same use as most overheads, checking for low blocks and getting counter hits on late buttons or throws.
