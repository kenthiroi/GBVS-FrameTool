The hurtbox is active before the hitbox is, leading to some weird-looking interactions where he gets hit by a button a screen away. It's not just when the move starts up, either. The hurtbox lingers far after it looks like it would be over, allowing for easy whiff punishes by most of the cast. To counteract these weaknesses, all you have to do is make sure it doesn't whiff.
