Does not hit Cross-Over.\nWhile not as strong as other more notorious mid range moves, such as Katalina's f.M, it's still a staple and strong move in neutral. What Ladiva truly lacks are specials that are suitable to be canceled into, however. All Lariats can be ducked and won't combo on crouching hit, making them all very punishable, and only EX Headbutt has the range, speed, and frame advantage to make it a strong special to cancel into. Even tho it may not combo on hit at max range, it's still a frametrap if canceled into on block. However, as expected, that means you forgo using Headbutt for a while.\nAs a whiff punish, it's very strong but do make sure you don't cancel into Lariat in case you catch them crouching."

Both share similar uses in neutral with small differences to make them cover different angles. 2M is safer on block and hit, and is one of the few moves Ladiva has that can hit Cross-Over. It's also the best option Ladiva has of hitting moves low to the ground, such as Ferry's 2M that f.M can't hit.\nTogether with f.M makes up the bread and butter of Ladiva's neutral and poking game.\nCounter hitting this vs a crouching opponent enables you to combo into 2U."

She can also safe-jump 11f DPs such as Charlotta Holy Ladder and Ferry's DP if you jump immediately after 2U and if it's a counter-hit then you can safe-jump even those 9f DPs. hitting 2U at max range also nets a safejump vs 9f DPs.2U is also a valuable whiff punish as well, and due to it's speed and good range it's very adept at that."
