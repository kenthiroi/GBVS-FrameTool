This can be used to change stances in neutral, by pressing 5U and then quickly tapping the guard button to cancel the recovery.\nIts most important property, however, is that this can be used while you're in the middle of a move. If used in this way, Narmaya has no extra recovery at all, and as soon as she returns to neutral, she'll be in the other stance. Mastering this is a core part of her corner combos and her pressure.\nFor those familiar with Jojo:HFTF, the idea behind each stance is similar to Chaka's Stand ON/OFF. With long-range tools such as f.M and Setsuna, Genji stance is an excellent neutral stance, whereas Kagura's faster normals with higher frame advantage make it an ideal stance for close ranges."
