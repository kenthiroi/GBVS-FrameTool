The hurtbox is active before the hitbox is, leading to some weird-looking interactions where he gets hit by a button a screen away. It's not just when the move starts up, either. The hurtbox lingers far after it looks like it would be over, allowing for easy whiff punishes by most of the cast. To counteract these weaknesses, all you have to do is make sure it doesn't whiff.

Since it covers a long range, it can be used as both a combo finished or a counter from afar. However, it will not hit at full-screen.

If this skill connects at close range, Percival will perform an enhanced version for increased damage. This move can be hard to combo into from midscreen juggles because of the flame spiral causing them to fall out. This leads to it being very unsafe as the opponent will typically tech through the fireball itself. \nThis super can be charged, which increases the hits of the initial tornado from a minimum 6 hits to a maximum of 12 hits. When charged for 6-11 hits, the final hit will do 1900 but when fully charged to 12 hits, the final hit will do 2000.\nWhen not at close range, the final swing will fire a bigger version of Anzünden that travels full screen. In certain situations in the corner, you can combo off this when setup properly.\nMin Damage: Technical 950→580[1160→760], Simple 760→580[960→760]"
