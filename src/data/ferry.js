Chase the projectile down to apply pressure and restrict the foe's movement options. Also serves as amazing combo filler when you have the meter to spend. Won't dissappear even if you get hit after it has come out. DOES NOT HAVE INVINCIBILITY FRAME 1 SO DO NOT USE IT AS A REVERSAL! Since the orb is guaranteed to come out after the super flash, it also serves as a very strong reactionary anti-air option. It will trade even with deep jump-ins while dispensing the full damage."

Each hit of an autocombo contributes to this 3-move limit. Hinrichten allows you to do a multitude of things, such as reverse beat your pokes into 2L to cut down their recovery, convert off of rising j.L instant overhead without a setup prior, and combo into 2U naturally for a hard knockdown. DOES NOT HAVE INVINCIBILITY FRAME 1 SO DO NOT USE IT AS A REVERSAL!\nWhile in install, specials will not recharge until install finishes. Recharging specials used before install became active will have their timers paused and will resume recharging once the install is over.\nThis can also be used as a pseudo chainshift/YRC. Buffering this input in neutral while in range can be good to start pressure or catch them during fireball startup.\nThere is currently no known difference between the easy input (214S) and the hard input (214214H)"

You can hitconfirm into this after successfully hitting f.M, f.H or 2M, by buffering 236236 and then hitting U when you see they got hit. It’s really easy so it’s highly recommended to learn it.\nThe easy input only affects the distance at which the cinematic occurs, and the cinematic does provide extra damage. At certain ranges where 236S+U and 236236U both won't activate the cinematic, there is no damage difference between the two inputs."
