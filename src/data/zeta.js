Good as an alternative combo ender from a midscreen auto combo hit if Spear of Arvess is on cooldown.\nUnlike some other armored moves in the game, like Katalina's Light Wall, Zeta can actually armor multiple hits.\nNone of the followups have any invincibility or armor, so they can be baited if the opponent uses a multi-hitting move to throw off the timing of her followup, or make it impossible for her to perform one safely.\nGetting hit by a high/low/mid that a version of Rhapsody does not cover leads to taking a counter hit.\nArmors highs and jumping attacks.\nIf you're not using the H version, you'll probably be using this version. Useful as an anti-air alternative for some tricky jump moves, or to call out some forward moving moves in neutral like Gran's Overdrive Surge. Cannot be used to call out low hitting forward moving moves, such as Eustace's Takedown. Especially risky against Percival as counter hit Schneiden leads to combos."

Can be used to escape the corner even if the opponent blocks on Zeta's wakeup since she'll cross behind them at an awkward angle to anti-air.\nCan be used to start pogo offense without a knockdown in the corner against an inattentive opponent, though this can be anti-aired.\nActs as a launcher, with more air untech time on the opponent when performed from the H version.
