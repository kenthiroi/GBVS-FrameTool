  description: "Fully invincible on startup\nVira's non-Skybound invincible reversal. Like most, it is able to escape pressure easily and doubles as a strong anti-air, but can almost never combo, making it very low reward. On block and whiff it is extremely punishable and must be used with caution. Only hits forwards, making it incapable of attacking enemies directly above or behind Vira.Completely air unblockable.\nExtreme meter gain, useful to transform as quickly as possible\nThe only version able to combo, and only on an anti-air hit in the corner.\nGrand: Additional 100 damage and cinematic pause if it hits on the first active frame, enabling better corner combo confirms.\nHer strongest anti-air move, it completely shuts down jump-ins while leading into okizeme. The massive cooldown, especially with the simple input, is a detriment to Vira's defensive gameplay, dramatically worsening her ability to defend herself immediately after. Particularly good late into a round, where a single shift in the momentum or increased damage can easily win the round on its own, and further defense is not nessecary."

The extended hitstun allows Vira to combo off attacks more easily, including her Overhead, and is delayed enough to allow a normal Throw or her Blade of Light grab to land before it becomes active. However, because it disappears instantly when Vira is hit, it does not protect Vira from an opponent attacking out of pressure.

However, it is very slow and open to punish.\nLuminiera spawns 40% of the screen away.\nUseful to set up after almost any knockdown cheaply. Due to its timing and position, it won't prevent jumping and backdashing on wakeup, which needs to be supported by fast okizeme. It is also spacing-sensitive, potentially whiffing (but catching backdashes) at very close positions.\nGood in neutral as a pre-emptive catch to approaches, but is too slow to be effective at its actual range."
