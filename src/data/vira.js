  description: "Summons Luminiera to attack a fixed position on the screen after a short time.\nLuminiera will disappear immediately if Vira blocks or is hit.\nThe primary tool for okizeme setplay. The extended hitstun allows Vira to combo off attacks more easily, including her Overhead, and is delayed enough to allow a normal Throw or her Blade of Light grab to land before it becomes active. However, because it disappears instantly when Vira is hit, it does not protect Vira from an opponent attacking out of pressure. (See more: Strategy: Okizeme)\nIn neutral, Luminiera can provide a ranged threat to either run in and begin pressure freely, or force the opponent into moving out of the way. However, it is very slow and open to punish.\nLuminiera spawns 70% of the screen away.\nSpawns too far away to use for setups, only able to catch backdashes after a non-cinematic Affection Abyss (236236H).\nA useful long-range tool for neutral."

Can combo better off slow recovering moves.\nGood for any knockdown without concern for spacing, and able to threaten backdashes by following their position, at the cost of a heavy cooldown. Due to longer recovery it can make some okizeme more difficult or weaker to jump-outs, notably after a Throw where you cannot prevent a jump-out in time.\nGood in neutral to make it much more difficult to position out of, and attack from almost full-screen as a weak zoning tool."

It not only has less vertical reach and fails to hit behind her, but it's also much more punishable when blocked at close range.\nTo compensate, the move does astronomically more damage, and can work from any range. It is impossible to jump over on reaction, and the pushback is enough to make it very difficult to punish unless already close, making it decent for challenging slower pokes in neutral, without losing the round."
