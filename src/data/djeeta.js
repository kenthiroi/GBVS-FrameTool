Excellent for dealing with crossups.\nCan be stuffed by some early jump normals, or very close range jumps. For these angles, c.H or Rising Sword can be better anti-airs.\nCombos into 5U or Rising Sword on normal hit.\nCounter hit conversions can be awkward. Juggles into f.M, f.H, or c.H depending on the height and distance the opponent was hit.

When done using the simple input, the rave will automatically be executed on hit at close range, but not on block.\nAllows Djeeta to confirm into her max damage Skybound Art from much further than most characters due to the technical input granting the full super animation as long as the first hit of the lunge collides with ANY hurtbox, including extended hurtboxes, well outside of it's intended clean hit window. Confirm this from f.M, 2M, or f.H for great returns on a single hit confirm.\nThis super doubles as a utility for punishing the opponent's projectiles at range, though it is not as consistent as some other supers at doing this due to it's lunge speed. Easy input is quick and great for reacting to close projectiles, while technical input is harder to do but rewards even greater damage from further out as long as the first hit of the lunge connects.\nGreat for heavily discouraging the opponent's projectiles, potentially putting the opposing character at a noticeable disadvantage in the neutral.\nThis super outside of SSBAs is the hardest hitting super in the game.\nBase damage for Reginleiv Azimuth (easy input) is 3500; minimum damage is 513. Base damage for Reginleiv Zenith (technical input) is 3700; minimum damage is 935.\nIn close to point-blank scenarios, delaying the 1st follow up as long as possible after the first is blocked can create a frame trap.\nSimple input super never grants a safe jump.\nDjeeta is +4 if she fails to complete the deadly rave at any follow-up."
