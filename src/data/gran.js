  description: "Gran dashes forward with his foot out. Covers a lot of horizontal space in front of him. As of 2.21 Patch no longer punishable on hit from point blank, but still negative enough to lose your turn. On block safety ranges depending on the range used. At point blank, Gran is punishable. However at farther lengths it can be spaced out to be safe and at most be 0 on block. On Counter Hit causes extended hitstun for a follow-up combo, but doesn't allow for a combo at point blank. Doesn't reliably combo from far pokes and the reduced hitbox and increased hurtbox with weak reward on hit makes it in the current meta a very mediocre move."

  description: "Wallbounces in the corner. \nGran's primary juggle starter. \nSimilar to 214M, but Gran dashes forward faster. Cannot be canceled into from 214L. Causes a wall bounce in the corner on hit regardless of counter hit, allowing for additional follow ups. Exercise caution as depending on the opponent's height when used, it can cause them to fall behind Gran after the wall bounce, possibly causing a side switch with yourself in the corner."
