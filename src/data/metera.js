The H version is used to knock down and for juggle combos.\nWhen used midair, Metera fires at a downward angle. The L & H versions fires at a steep downward shot, M fires a more horizontal shot. Good for counter-pokes.\nThe L & M versions totally cancels your original momentum with a small forward hop, while H version can keep most of it's momentum.\nThe M Ground & Midair arrow will cause a Soft Knock Down on counterhit.\nThe H midair arrow can be combo starter for a 2h hop loop.\nAll versions activates Aetherial Seal.
