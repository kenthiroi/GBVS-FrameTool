It also frame traps from 2H(1), which does leave you close enough for a c.L combo, but only at point blank range."

It will never frame trap, but because Yuel moves forward during its startup, it can be used as a disrespectful pressure extension once your opponent starts respecting your actual frame traps. If your opponent somehow gets hit by this, you can follow up with a c.H combo."

If your opponent doesn't mash, you can continue pressure due to it being advantageous on block. In addition, it will always combo from an air hit of 2H, making it useful for anti-air combos and certain punishes."
