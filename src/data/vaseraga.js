The move is safe on block and can be granted armor by Soul Forge. These properties encourage the enemy to attempt to poke out of it in order to avoid the guard crush, which you can punish by releasing the button to hit them before they break your armor however there is a specific timing to spotdodge that will allow them to avoid the guard crush and punish. The move is also prominently used as filler in his corner 214X loops, and as an ender in the corner BnB combo. Effective use of this move is essential for Vaseraga players. Outside of combos, it is your main frametrap option while in stance. If this move counter hits the opponent or catch them while airborne it will lead into game ending damage."

  description: "Stomps on Grynoth unleashing a damaging blast. This skill has armor properties independent of Soul Forge and will armor any number of hits until active. This followup is significantly more unsafe on block than the H followup, a property that when combined with its unique armor property, means that it is intended to be used as a bait and punish against enemy reversals when you do not already have armor ready. When you have Soul Forge already, the 2 hits act as a buffer you can use to react to the hitstop of multi-hitting reversals and score a punish. This takes a lot of practice, but it will make Savage Rampage even more threatening.\nThis move also serves as a necessary defense against opponents simply using SBA/SSBA against you in stance. While experienced opponents know better than to try, never forget to simply push U against newcomers trying to beat your stance with supers."

This skill has invincibility properties and advances considerably forward, but it is not the most reliable option against fireballs. This super converts very well from f.L/f.M/f.H so long as you are not at absolute max range, but you will not get max damage in these situations. If you trigger the full animation, it will add a massive amount of damage to his combos. A versatile Skybound Art all things considered."

  description: "Moves slightly forward and unleashes a moderately sized vertical burst attack, sending any foes caught in it flying. Has armor during the start-up, which means it is significantly harder to safejump by normal means. However, hitbox is smaller than it appears, especially horizontally, making this super difficult to use in neutral or as a reversal option. Is a poor reversal compared with Bloody Moon, as the armor on the move's start-up is treated the same as blocking an attack. This means that if their button makes contact early enough and can get through hitstop of their attack, the opponent can dodge to avoid the Vaseraga's super and get a significant punish. Despite these flaws, this super does massive damage and is good anti air in a lot of situations his 2H would hit, however you need to be quick to react."
